### Spring 2021

## Project Description:
##### Participated in a Kaggle Competition for building a Multiple Linear Regression model to best predict NBA player salaries using their statistics
##### Built, tested, and adjusted MLR model using a training data set provided in the competition. My model incorporated 16 statistical predictors, including latent variables constructed using other variables
##### My model achieved an R2 score of 0.778 when used to predict salaries for the testing data set
##### Came in 1st place out of 52 competitors in the Kaggle Competition
